# Archon Technical Documentation

## System Overview

Archon is a multi-agent AI system designed to autonomously build, refine, and optimize other AI agents. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the system architecture using UML 2.5 diagrams.

## UML Diagrams

### 1. Class Diagram (core-components.puml)

The class diagram illustrates the static structure of the system's core components:

- **Workflow Engine**: Contains the StateGraph and AgentState classes that manage the workflow execution
- **Core Agents**: Shows the inheritance hierarchy of specialized agents (Reasoner, Router, Coder)
- **Documentation System**: Details the classes handling document processing and embedding
- **UI Layer**: Presents the Streamlit interface components

Key relationships:
- Agent inheritance hierarchy showing specialization
- Dependencies between components and their required services
- Composition relationships in the documentation system

### 2. Sequence Diagram (agent-creation-flow.puml)

The sequence diagram demonstrates the interaction flow during agent creation:

1. User initiates request through StreamlitUI
2. StateGraph orchestrates the workflow
3. ReasonerAgent analyzes requirements and creates scope
4. CoderAgent generates implementation with RAG support
5. RouterAgent manages conversation flow
6. Response streams back to user

This diagram helps understand:
- Temporal ordering of operations
- Message flow between components
- Parallel operations and their synchronization
- System response streaming

### 3. Activity Diagram (workflow-process.puml)

The activity diagram shows the business process flow:

- Initial user input processing
- Parallel documentation and requirement analysis
- Iterative code generation loop
- Decision points for user feedback
- Final agent delivery

Key aspects:
- Fork/join for parallel processing
- Decision nodes for workflow routing
- Activity partitions by component
- Feedback loops in development

### 4. Component Diagram (system-architecture.puml)

The component diagram illustrates the system's architectural structure:

- External Systems:
  * OpenAI API (Chat and Embeddings)
  * Supabase (Vector Store and SQL)
- Internal Components:
  * Streamlit UI
  * Workflow Engine
  * Agent System
  * Documentation System
  * Memory System

Interfaces and dependencies are clearly shown, highlighting:
- System boundaries
- External service dependencies
- Internal component relationships
- Interface definitions

### 5. State Diagram (conversation-flow.puml)

The state diagram shows the conversation lifecycle:

- Initialization states
- Main workflow states:
  * Scope Definition
  * Code Generation
  * Conversation Routing
- Transition conditions
- Terminal states

This diagram helps understand:
- System state changes
- Valid state transitions
- Composite states
- Entry/exit points

## Implementation Notes

1. **Modularity**: The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to:
   - Add new agent types
   - Extend documentation processing
   - Modify workflow rules
   - Update UI components

2. **Scalability**: The architecture supports scaling through:
   - Async operations
   - Parallel processing
   - Memory management
   - State persistence

3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added by:
   - Implementing new agent types
   - Adding workflow nodes
   - Extending the documentation system
   - Creating new UI components

4. **Maintenance**: The system is maintainable through:
   - Clear component boundaries
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - State management
   - Error handling

## Future Considerations

1. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

2. **Monitoring**:
   - System health metrics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

3. **Security**:
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data encryption
   - API security

4. **Optimization**:
   - Caching strategies
   - Resource management
   - Performance tuning
   - Cost optimization

## Conclusion

The UML documentation provides a comprehensive view of Archon's architecture, helping developers understand the system's structure, behavior, and interactions. This documentation serves as a foundation for future development and maintenance.
